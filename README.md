# Automatic-Essay-Evaluation

This project explores automatic essay grading using machine learning and NLP. LSTM and SVM models analyze factors like cohesion, syntax, and vocabulary to score essays (1-5) on IELTS/TOEFL scales. Trained on pre-graded essays, the system removes human bias and promises consistent, efficient grading. Dive in to see how language tech can revolutionize education!

**Highlights:**

* **Machine learning magic:** LSTM and SVM models handle the grading.
* **Objective and consistent:** Eliminates human bias and subjectivity.
* **Evolved analysis:** Considers key factors like cohesion and vocabulary.
* **Ready to test:** Trained on pre-graded essays and ready for evaluation.

**Join the project:** Explore the code, contribute, and be part of the future of automated essay grading!
